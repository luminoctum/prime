/**
 * MODEL INPUT FILE
 * Stardard c comments like "//" are used. The program will skip the line after "//".
 * Input information for any variable is organized as:
 *
 * "variable_name [option1, option2,...] = index : value;"
 *
 * variable_name : lowercase c name identifier, long names are sperated by "_".
 * option        : different options of this variable. If it is only a choice, it is encapsulated
 *                 by "". Otherwise it could be anything that indicates this option. Different 
 *                 options are sperated by comma(,). If there is only one option in the square 
 *                 paranthesis, the literal meaning of this option is not read by the program. It 
 *                 is usually used for incation of units.
 * index         : indicate which option to use. It uses standard c convection, 0 being the first.
 * value         : value of the variable. It only exists when the option is not encapsulated by "".
